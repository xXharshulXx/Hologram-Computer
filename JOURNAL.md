## 10/22/2025 - Started the project, did research and setup  

Date: October 22, 2025 [DAY 1]
Time: 09:00 PM

Today I started working on my hologram computer project. I mostly did research on what parts I’ll need & I made a [Bill Of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X7Jmkf1zUvFoCzqxnc55CjRoqIcL8RPE9PKFAF0yoDc/edit?usp=sharing)... like the Raspberry Pi 5, a projector, a conductive sheet, a rubber mat. I also watched a few videos to understand how capacitive touch works and how I could use it with Python.

Then I installed Pygame, python-dotenv and some other libraries I’ll need later. I tried to deisgn a rough sketch of the the UI interface a bit but not much. Mostly just setting up the files and figuring out how everything will work. It was a slow start today but I got the basics ready. << This includes setting up Hacktime and Wakatime too...

## 10/23/2025 1 AM - Finished the UI for the Home Page... (I'll test it tomorrow)  

Date: October 23, 2025 [DAY 2]
Time: 01:30 AM

Tonight I worked on creating the Home Screen UI. I used Python for this... I havent tested the output yet but if I did everything correctly there should be a circular logo in the center, surrounded by applications with their own smaller circular logos. I added some animations and sound effects to bring the UI to life when the buttons are clicked. 

Fortunately once I got the coordinates of the icons the animations and sound effects were fairly easy...

On the other hand... Unfortunately the circle coordinates, alignment and animations did consume a lot of time and caused quite a few issues. 

Overall I am quite happy with my progress for today. Hopefully when I test everything tomorrow it works as I planned it to... If not I hope its an easy fix... 

and finally... Good Night!

## 10/23/2025 4 PM - Created a Measurement App...  

Date: October 23, 2025 [DAY 2]
Time: 4:00 PM

Today I worked on coding one of the multiple apps that are going to be in this project. This app was a measurement app that allows me to draw a line on the surface and it measures the distance between the two points in millimeters. I used Pygame for the visuals and interaction.

In this app when the user drags between two points, the projector draws a light-blue line and shows the measured distance at the center. I also added a “Home” button to go back and a “Clear” button to reset all lines.

Overall it all went fairly smoothly and the UI looks decent. Also I like the sound effects when making and clearing the drawings, it makes the whole app look much more interactive!

(btw it broke down at one point cause I wrote apped instead of append 🥲  << that was pretty annoying)   

## 10/23/2025 11 PM - We've got GAMES! 👽👾  

Date: October 23, 2025 [DAY 2]
Time: 11:00 PM

Tonight I created a space invaders game for my hologram. I used some pre-made assets from the internet for the aliens and the player. I implemented sounds for shooting like lasers etc... 

So far it went pretty well. I plan on adding a brick breaker game tomorrow.

Also I managed to get the home button and shooting mechanics working. But for some reason the aliens arent moving yet :(

Anyways it was a productive night I hope to get both the games finished by tomorrow evening so I can start working on adding an app to listen to music while working! (Spotify :D)
